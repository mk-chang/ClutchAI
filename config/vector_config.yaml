# Vector Manager Configuration
# Configuration for YouTube channel processing pipelines

youtube_channel:
  # Maximum number of videos to add per run (stops after N videos are successfully added)
  # Set to null or omit to add all videos
  max_videos_added: null
  
  # Delay between videos in seconds (to avoid rate limiting)
  delay_between_videos: 12.0
  
  # Note: chunk_size_seconds is defined in config/rag_config.yaml
  # This script will use that value to maintain consistency across the codebase
