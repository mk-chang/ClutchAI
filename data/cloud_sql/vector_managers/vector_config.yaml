# Vector Manager Configuration
# Configuration for YouTube channel processing pipelines

youtube_channel:
  # Maximum number of videos to process per run
  # Set to null or omit to process all videos
  max_videos: 10
  
  # Delay between videos in seconds (to avoid rate limiting)
  delay_between_videos: 12.0
  
  # Note: chunk_size_seconds is defined in agents/rag/rag_config.yaml
  # This script will use that value to maintain consistency across the codebase
